# Data_Structures
This repository includes some of the main data structures that were taught in my Data Structures course at my university in which we were required to implement. These data structures include Dynamic Arrays, 
Linked Lists, Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Min Heap Binary Tree, and HashMaps. These implemented data structures also utilize abstract data types (ADTs). The ADTs Stack, Queues, and Deques were 
utilized for the Linked List data structure. The Bag ADT was utilized with the Dynamic Array data structure. Priority Queues and Heaps ADTs were utilized with the MinHeap data structure.
